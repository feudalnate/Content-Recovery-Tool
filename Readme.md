> WARNING: The following content packages are "simple content"

This warning describes content packages where the external content files were "signed" manually by the developer and external content files are not validated by the Xbox itself like a standard content package.
<br><br>
Signing this kind of content cannot be broadly supported because each developer could sign their content differently. Support for this type of content would need to be implemented on a game by game basis.
